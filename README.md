Game of Life background animation created using canvas and javascript; cell states follow the rules of Conway's Game of Life. Cells are randomly seeded at the start of the animation. 

Future plans: allow click-based editing, stop/start/reset of animation, and pre-defined seeding that produce interesting growth patterns.
